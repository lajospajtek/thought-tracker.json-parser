This package implements a JSON parser. Parsing may be chunk-wise, i.e. one does not
need to buffer the whole JSON before parsing but one may invoke the parse method on
every JSON chunk individually, as they arrive.

The essential files are json_scanner.hh and json_parser.hh.

A client may hook callback functions that are invoked when the parser encounters various
tokens. See json_parser.hh. Predefined callbacks that construct a sort of DOM tree are
given in json_tree.hh and json_tree.cc. They are not mandatory.

A usage example is given in usage_example.cc.

More usage examples are shown in the unit tests (unit/test_json_parser.*).

Code documentation is generated by "make doc" and it can be found in the
doxygen sub-directory of the source tree.

INSTALL lists the Debian packages required for compilation of the usage example,
unit test and code coverage campaign executions.

Please report bugs to Sorin Manolache <sorinm@gmail.com>.
